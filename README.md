## Summary

This is a flashcards program, supposed to help people with exercising foreign languages. You prepare an XML file with vocabulary (exported from Excel) and the program will show it to you and ask for translation. There are lots of such programs in the Internet, I tried a few of them and they didn't satisfy me and I am not willing to try more of them, because I am a software engineer, so why not practice C# and make my own stuff.

The application is named Nippori, because I like travelling to Japan, especially Tokyo, and [Nippori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippori_Station) is one of my favorite Tokyo train stations. It is not my top favorite, that is [Minami-Senju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minami-Senju_Station), because it is close to hotel [Juyoh](http://www.juyoh.co.jp/) where I usually stay, but I already used the name Minami-Senju for my another project, so I had to use my second favorite station for this flashcards app. I like the name, because it sounds cool Japan and I like the station, because it is close to [Yanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanaka_Cemetery) area and it is also terminal of [Nippori-Toneri Liner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippori-Toneri_Liner), an automated guideway transit system, which is fancy name for a train without driver. I like those Japanese hi-tech transportation systems, that's why I created this app, so I can learn Japanese and next time in Japan speak to the locals and understand local writings like a boss. You should go to Japan and visit Tokyo, I strongly recommend it.
