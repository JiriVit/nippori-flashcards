## Summary

This is kind of a flashcards program, supposed to help me learning Asian languages. I create lists of vocables in Excel, then export to XML and load into this app. Then it shows me the vocables in random order and I have to guess the translation. Just like flashcards. Not that there aren't any flashcard programs available, but I've tried a few of them with very little satisfaction. So I've decided to create my own. Because I can. I'm a software engineer and I can make my own software stuff.

The application is named Nippori after a JR station in Tokyo, because very far in the past I used to travel to Japan for leisure and I really liked the train system there. But now I'm a geront approaching his 40s and a midlife crisis, so I've lost my enthusiasm for travelling and I prefer coding and studying languages (it helps to delay Alzheimer's, they say) and that's exactly why I'm working on this app.
