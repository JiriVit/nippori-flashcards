- Add selection for serif / sans serif font for Asian characters.
- Add quiz where English translation + transcription are given and the user is
  supposed to choose signs from more similar options. This helps to memorize the
  precise image of the signs.
- Rename 'Active' column to 'Status' and support more values, not only active
  and inactive. We need to separate vocables which are already learnt, so we
  don't want to examine them always. Only when desired.
- Add option to switch between random and sequence order of the words.
- Add button to reset temporarily disabled vocables.
- Add message box to notify about some events.
- Add option to include some vocabulary in the app and also to update it from
  GitHub.


IMPLEMENTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add selection of JLPT level. Use it to emphasize kanji for this level (and
  lower) when learning kana -> kanji, and to select only necessary vocables
  when learning kanji -> kana.
- Add detection of kanji in Japanese vocables, allow to limit the examination
  to kanji vocables only.
- Choose better font for Chinese / Japanese characters. With the current one
  the characters are sometimes wrong.
