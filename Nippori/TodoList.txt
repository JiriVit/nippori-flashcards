- Choose better font for Chinese / Japanese characters. With the current one
  the characters are sometimes wrong.
- Add quiz where English translation + transcription are given and the user is
  supposed to choose signs from more similar options. This helps to memorize the
  precise image of the signs.
- Add selection of JLPT level. Use it to emphasize kanji for this level (and
  lower) when learning kana -> kanji, and to select only necessary vocables
  when learning kanji -> kana.
- Rename 'Active' column to 'Status' and support more values, not only active
  and inactive. We need to separate vocables which are already learnt, so we
  don't want to examine them always. Only when desired.
