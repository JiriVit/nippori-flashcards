TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add selection for serif / sans serif font for Asian characters.
- Add quiz where English translation + transcription are given and the user is
  supposed to choose signs from more similar options. This helps to memorize the
  precise image of the signs.
- Add quiz where user has to read certain hanzi/kanji in paragraph if continous
  text.
- Add option to switch between random and sequence order of the words.
- Add message box to notify about some events.
- Add option to include some vocabulary in the app and also to update it from
  GitHub.
- Don't use kanji above selected JLPT level at all. Don't show them.
- Emphasize only single JLPT kanjis, not whole field (using RichTextBox).
- Split groups to level, lexical categories and groups (used purely to split
  vocables to batches for easier training), allow selection of those separately.
- Add presets (eg. this lesson, these groups, this type).
- Remember recently used presets.
- Add separate option to examine katakana only.
- Add option to search for stroke order for the character.
  - For Chinese it is http://www.strokeorder.info/mandarin.php?q=X
- When hovering over a vocable, show list of options, including copy to
  clipboard, look up in a dictionary, look up in Google Images, look up in
  Google Translator (to read aloud).
- Replace the Ribbon with UWP-like sidebar.

IMPLEMENTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add option to copy contents of fields to clipboard.
- Add selection of JLPT level. Use it to emphasize kanji for this level (and
  lower) when learning kana -> kanji, and to select only necessary vocables
  when learning kanji -> kana.
- Add detection of kanji in Japanese vocables, allow to limit the examination
  to kanji vocables only.
- Choose better font for Chinese / Japanese characters. With the current one
  the characters are sometimes wrong.
- Add option to reset temporarily disabled vocables.
- Add option to enable/disable active/easy/difficult vocables.
- When closing type / group selection, restart training only if something was
  actually changed.
